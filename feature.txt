In this assignment we have to practice basic git commands.
We are also going to deliberately create a conflict and will then try to resolve it.
The repository is in my own personal github account. Name of the repository is Squarelings.

warning: in the working copy of 'feature.txt', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
